# Chat Voice Unity for LiteNetLib

Forked from @AxelSilverdew

A implementation of Voice Chat for the Unity, using the LiteNetLib to send data updated by me.

Considerations

if you use this package using unity versions with Visual script it is necessary to remove or remove Ionic.Zlib from the plugin folder of the project
