# Chat Voice Unity for LiteNetLib

Forked from @AxelSilverdew

A implementation of Voice Chat for the Unity, using the LiteNetLib to send data updated by me.

Considerations

if you use this package using unity versions with Visual Scripting installed it is necessary to remove or remove Ionic.Zlib from the project plugins folder

this package provides example of a simple prefab instantiation and network system to use the voice chat for each entity instantiated
